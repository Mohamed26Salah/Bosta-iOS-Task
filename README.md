This is a simple iOS app built using Swift, UIKit, MVVM architecture, Combine, Moya, and other libraries to display user albums and their photos. The app fetches data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), and allows users to view albums, explore photo details, and search for images by title. It also includes a bonus feature of viewing images with zooming and sharing functionalities.
